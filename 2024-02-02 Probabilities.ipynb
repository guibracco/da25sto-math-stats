    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials with the same probability of success. A Bernoulli trial is a random experiment with exactly two possible outcomes, \"success\" and \"failure\", in which the probability of success is the same every time the experiment is conducted.\n",

    "The probability of getting exactly `k` successes (which can be hits, correct guesses etc.) in `n` trials (repeated attempts) is given by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "# $$ P(X=k) = C(n, k) \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `P(X=k)` is the probability of `k` successes in `n` trials,\n",
    "- `C(n, k)` is the number of combinations of `n` items taken `k` at a time,\n",
    "- `p` is the probability of success in a given trial, and\n",
    "- `(1-p)` is the probability of failure (which is 1 minus the probability of success).\n",
    "\n",
    "`C(n, k)` can be calculated as `n! / [k!(n-k)!]` where `!` denotes factorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution is used when there are exactly two mutually exclusive outcomes of a trial, often referred to as \"success\" and \"failure\". The parameters of a binomial distribution are `n` and `p` where `n` is the total number of trials, and `p` is the probability of success in a given trial. The distribution is suitable for the models where the outcome of one trial does not affect the outcome of another trial."

After the contestant chooses a door, the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat.

Should they switch? Does it matter?\n",

Because there is no perceived reason to change, most stick with their initial choice.\n",
