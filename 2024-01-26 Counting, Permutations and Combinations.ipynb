    "## Counting and Rule of Product\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rule of Product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a basic rule in combinatorics (the study of counting, arrangement, and combination). It states that if there are `n` ways to do one thing, and `m` ways to do another, then there are `n * m` ways of doing both.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule can be extended to more than two stages. If there are `n1` ways to do the first thing, `n2` ways to do the second thing, `n3` ways to do the third thing, and so on, then there are `n1 * n2 * n3 * ...` ways to do all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** The Rule of Product cannot be applied when the events or choices are not independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the Rule of Product is only applicable when the choices or events are independent of each other, meaning the choice or outcome of one event does not affect the choices or outcomes of the other events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "If a meal consists of a choice of 4 appetizers, 3 main courses, and 5 desserts, how many different meals can be ordered?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "How many different 7-digit telephone numbers can be formed if the first digit cannot be zero?"
